# City, University of London Year 1 Java Game Project

Built with the CityEngine Library, property of the University. The library was originally written by Dr Seb Hunt, with a major overhaul by Dr Ross Paterson and mods by several other lecturers at City. It is a user-friendly wrapper around the JBox2D library, a Java port of the original C++ Box2D.
