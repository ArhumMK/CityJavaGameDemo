# City, University of London Year 1 Java Game Project

A Castlevania inspired clone written in Java with the CityEngine library.

It uses the following asset packs by Progmancer (https://programancer.itch.io/)

- https://programancer.itch.io/spooky-nes-style-horror-asset-pack-1
- https://programancer.itch.io/spooky-nes-style-horror-asset-pack-2

The background music tracks are taken from the game "Bloodstained Curse of the Moon" as placeholders.

Built with the CityEngine Library, property of the University. The library was originally written by Dr Seb Hunt, with a major overhaul by Dr Ross Paterson and mods by several other lecturers at City. It is a user-friendly wrapper around the JBox2D library, a Java port of the original C++ Box2D.
